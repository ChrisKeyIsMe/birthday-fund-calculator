# birthday-fund-calculator ver 1.0
### Quick Description:
Calculator for determining how much everybody on your team should contribute

### How to use:
Download the folder, then drag the "index.html" file into your browser. The calculator takes three pieces of info:
+ The number of people on your team
+ The amount you're allocated for each birthday
+ The number of birthdays for the month

The result is split into two categories:
+ The amount that people without birthdays should contribute that month
+ The amount that people with a birthday should contribute that month (Note that people aren't expected to contribute for their own birthday party.

### Contributors and Thanks
