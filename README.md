# birthday-fund-calculator ver 1.0
### Quick Description:
This calculator is used for determining how much everybody on your team should contribute for birthdays in a given month. You'll provide the amount that you can spend per birthday, the number of members on your team and the number of birthdays for a given month. You'll be given the amounts that members should contribute for the entire month!

### How to use:
Download the folder, then drag the "index.html" file into your browser. The calculator takes three pieces of info:
+ The number of people on your team
+ The amount you're allocated for each birthday
+ The number of birthdays for the month

The result is split into two categories:
+ The amount that people without birthdays should contribute that month
+ The amount that people with a birthday should contribute that month (Note that people aren't expected to contribute for their own birthday party, but they will be asked to contribute for other birthdays if there are more birthdays for that month)

### Intended future updates:
1. Conversion to allow everybody to contribute equally to a single party
2. Easy currency converter (currently, this calculator is set for Singapore dollars)
3. Maybe turn this into an app? (I have no idea how to accomplish this yet)
